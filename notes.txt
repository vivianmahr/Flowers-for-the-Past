BG1 is for the floor
BG2 is for ledges, things that go over the floor
EF  is for the seeded tiles
ENT and MC should be replaced with object layers for entities and the  Mc respectively
OVR1 is for ledges, BG1 element
OVR2 is for ledges, EF elements
OVR3 things on ledges, 1
OVR4 is for things on ledges, 2
OVR5 is for things on ledges, 3

...I think the MC will have to have a z value to figure out where to render it



-2-2-2 is for no element / cannot apply element
222 is for magic/life
